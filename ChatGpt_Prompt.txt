You are a professional web developer. I want you to design and code a modern personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React / Next.js if I ask).
Here’s my portfolio information:
Name: shivakant shukla
Tagline / Role: java developer
About Me: software engineer
Skills: , Java, Spring Boot, React, SQL, AWS
Projects:XYZ
Contact Info: ss68644@gmail.com
✨ Design Instructions:
Make it clean, minimal, and responsive.
Include sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.
Use modern colors, smooth animations, and readable typography.
Add hover effects on project cards and social icons.
⚙️ Technical Instructions:
Code should be well-structured and commented.
Use a separate CSS file for styling.
Include icons from Font Awesome.
Ensure it’s mobile-friendly.
🎨 Optional Add-ons (if I request later):
Dark/Light theme toggle
Downloadable resume button
Contact form with email integration
Animated skills progress bars
Typewriter effect in hero section
Once generated, if I say something like:
👉 “Update my portfolio: change the color theme to blue and add a new project about an AI chatbot,”
then update the existing portfolio accordingly — without rewriting it completely.
